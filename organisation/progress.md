# Progress so far
This is just to keep track of how we have gone so far.

## 2021

### 11 - 04

Started with the introduction and got up to the point of going through the data pull. Didn't go into any real depth of how the code worked (it makes sense that they go through this on their own if they want).

Highlights:

* Mentioned that they could go beyond what we have done if they want - they have relative freedom as long as they stick to the general scope of the project
* Initially we had some good suggestions for what we might look to do conceptually

Need to do:

* Give a more proper introduction to how they can execute code etc. - should cover this in the next session as part of the crash course
* It would be good to cover the last bit joining the data at the start of the crashcourse - could use it as an example of loading data
* Need to fix accesses and stuff and publish GitHub link on Moddle

### 01 - 13
Up until now we have managed to reach the part on choosing variables, and we still have to cover model training and evaluation.

In theory there are 4 sessions left for the first evaluation (unclear if there is a specific deadline).

We will probably have to do a bit of a catch up because people will need to turn back on --> so for the 13th we can review what we have done so far and what choosing variables is about.

Then towards the end of the 13th we can introduce model training and bring it back on the 20th. Then towards the end of the class we can talk about evaluation, re-introducing on the 27th --> and then the last class is a free class.
