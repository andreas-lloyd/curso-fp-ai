# Progress so far
This is just to keep track of how we have gone so far.

Started with the introduction and got up to the point of going through the data pull. Didn't go into any real depth of how the code worked (it makes sense that they go through this on their own if they want).

Highlights:

* Mentioned that they could go beyond what we have done if they want - they have relative freedom as long as they stick to the general scope of the project
* Initially we had some good suggestions for what we might look to do conceptually

Need to do:

* Give a more proper introduction to how they can execute code etc. - should cover this in the next session as part of the crash course
* It would be good to cover the last bit joining the data at the start of the crashcourse - could use it as an example of loading data
* Need to fix accesses and stuff and publish GitHub link on Moddle
